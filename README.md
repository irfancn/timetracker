# timetracker
A python based application to keep track of the time spent on different tasks. This is developed for debian based linux, not sure if this works on other OS.

--> Need to run the 'timetrack.py' file. Some dependencies (python3) are required and imported during the run

--> Name of the tasks can be modified in the 'timetrack.py' file (changing the variable 'Applications').

--> Data is saved into a .json file in dict format arranged properly.


Run
1. Download and keep all files in the same directory
2. In terminal (inside this directory) : python3 timetrack.py
3. In the window, different tasks could be chosen to start and pause the time.
4. To see the time spent on each tasks, click the 'Plot' button after filling in the number of days required (eg: 1 for the current day, 7 for the last week).
